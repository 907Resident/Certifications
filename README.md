# Certifications
Certifications and awards through works related to data science. 

The documents are a summary of the certifications and awards I have earned in online courses related to data science.

*Please note*: I acknowledge that many of my certifications were earned using the DataCamp platform. During Dec 2020, I learned about the reinstatement of the DataCamp CEO mentioned in this [article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup). I have ended my subscription with DataCamp, and will no longer contribute financially to their platform. Once my subscription expires, I will no longer patronize the platform.
